#### Solution
<ol type="a">
  <li>
    <b>Yes</b> As in most of the school <i> school_id </i> are unique identifier of a student $\therefore$ it is a primary key.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>No</b> Easily you can found 2 students with same name in a school, $\therefore$ it cannot be a primary key.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>No</b> If two students from the same family are in the school, $\therefore$ it cannot be a primary key.

#### Solution
<ol type="a">
  <li>
    <b>ISBN</b> The International Standard Book Number (ISBN) is a unique identifier for books, as the definition of ISBN is $\therefore$ this is the only primary key among all fields.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>(title, publication_date) </b> cannot be a composite key, because in the same year of publication there should not be the same title published. $\therefore$ this composite key is hard to make.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>(title, no_of_pages) </b> cannot be a composite key, because it can be possible that other book with the same title will have same number of pages, if it has to be the composite key, it has to be the unique title and number of pages.
  </li>
</ol>

#### Solution
<ol type="a">
  <li>
    <b>SSN(Social Security Number)</b> This is the only key among all the fields because it is a unique identifier of a person in USA.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>(name, street_address) </b> cannot be a composite key, because if two persons with the same name lives on the same street then it can't be the composite key. $\therefore$ it is highly unlikely that this can be the composite key.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>(name, street_address, city) </b> cannot be a composite key, to be the composite key, there should not be two persons living at same street at in the same city. Which seems to be unlikely.
  </li>
</ol>

#### Solution
Joining m tuple A and n tuple B on p columns, $\therefore$ m + n - p is the solution.</br>

#### Solution
Note that we lose information when we delete columns. Therefore we might have more in the second set than in the first, since it could be easier to be in the intersection in the second case. A simple example would be to </br>
let $R = \{(a,b)\}$ and $S = \{(a,c)\}$, $n = 2, m = 1$, and $i_1 = 1$. </br>
Then $R \bigcap S = \phi$, so $P_{1}(R \bigcap S) = \phi$. On the other hand, $P_{1}(R) = P_{1}(S) = \{ (a) \}$, so $P_{1}(R) \bigcap P_{1}(S) = \{ (a) \}$.

![problem 32](https://github.com/jigjnasu/discrete_mathematics_and_its_applications/blob/master/chapter_9_relations/9.2_n-ary_relations_and_their_applications/repo/problem_32.png)
#### Solution
As the primary key uniquely determines the n-tuple. Therefore we can think n-tuple as a pair of primary key with another. The set of all such n - 1 pairs is by definition of the graph of the function from the subset of domain of the domain of the primary key consisting of those values that appear to the Cartesian product of the the n-1 domains.
