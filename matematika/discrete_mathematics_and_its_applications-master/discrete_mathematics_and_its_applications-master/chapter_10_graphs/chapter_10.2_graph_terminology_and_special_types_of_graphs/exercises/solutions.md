#### Solution

According to theorem 2 *An undirected graph has an even number of vertices of odd degree*. </br>
Therefore according to this theorem it is not possible to have as 15 is an odd number and all have 5 degree means odd degree. According to theorem odd degree vertices should be an even number. </br>

Let's the vertex $v$ represents a person and the edge $e$ represents the handshake between two people. </br>
The degree $deg(v)$ of a vertex represents with how many people that person shook the hand. </br>
Regardless number of vertices, the sum of degree of vertices will be even because it is twice the number of edges. </br>

Let a graph $G$ has $n$ vertices and $m$ edges. </br>
The degree of a vertex can range from $deg = \lbrace 0,1,2,..., n-1 \rbrace$ as it is a simple graph. </br>

#### Solution

Let in a graph $G$, where vertex $v$ is a person, who has friendship with another person depicted by a simple graph. </br>
$u,v$ means u and v are friends. </br>
The degree of any vertex can $deg = \lbrace 0, 1, 2, ..., n-1 \rbrace$ as one cannot be friend with himself. </br>

#### Solution

**No** it is **NOT** a bipartite graph because $(c,d)$ and $(d,e)$ vertices are on the same bracket or in the same color blue / red </br>

#### Solution

| Graph Type            | bipartite     | not bipartite     |   Note        |
| :------:              | :------:      | :------:          |   :------:    |
| $K_n$                 | $K_2$         | $K_n$ where $n > 2$| $K_1$ is not applicable             |
| $C_n$                 | $C_n$ where $n$ is even             | $C_n$ where $n$ is odd | NA |
| $W_n$                 | None          | $W_n$ where $n > 2$ | Every graph has a triangle |
| $Q_n$                 | $Q_n$ where $n > 1$          | None | NA |
