### Solution
##### Naive Iterative Power Algorithm, will always have worst case of n multiplication,
therefore, when n grows, the time complexity grows with n as well. But this is not the best solution
to calculate the power of base to the exponent. We can have a divide and conquer method.

##### Divide and Conquer Power Algortim, will have O(lg n) because of divide and conquer.
So when n grows time complexity will grow by lg n, which will me very efficient than n.

![solution 24](https://github.com/cpp-rakesh/discrete_mathematics_and_its_applications/blob/master/chapter_3_algorithms/3.3_complexity_Of_algorithms/exercises/repo/images/solution_24.jpg)

###Solution (a)
#### Explanation:--
1. With this algortithm we will be having worst case scenario n comparisons, therefore, its time complexity is O(n).
2. We can't use divide and conquer method to find, because the input list is not sorted it is unsorted. There is no way to find how to split the search.
3. We can use the max heap data structure, as it has only O(1) search for max element, however this is not the case as well as we have array type input.

By looking at the above arguments it seems that linear search for max element is optimal solution.

### Solution (b)
Yes it is a optimal soltution.

### Solution

### Solution a)
1. Iterate through 1 to n - m.
2. Compare str[i] to target[0].
3. If found, compare target with str starting at ith location. If not found there is no match.
4. If not found in the whole string, there is no match.

### Solution b)

### Solution c)
Let's calculate the time complexity.
1. First loop will run n - m + 1 times.

2. The first if condition will run n - m times, in worst case.

3. The for loop inside the match function will run, m times.

4. The condition inside the match function will have m - 1 worst case.

5. Total (n - m + 1).(n - m + (m) + m - 1)

6. (n - m).m = O(nm - m^2).
