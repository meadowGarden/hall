#### Solution
In Algorithm 2, we have (n + 1) multiplications for f(n), because f(n) = a * f(n - 1).

#### Solution
In Algorithm 7, we have O(n) additions, because it is an itrative solution, we need to add last two values to get nth fibonacci number.
In Algorithm 8, we have O(2^n) additions, because it is a recrusive solution, where f(n) = f(n - 1) + f(n - 2).
We are adding twice the number of operations for every n.

#### Solution
Iterative solution has O(n) time complexity.
Where as recursive solution has O(3^n) time complexity, because of duplicate call of f(n - 1), f(n - 2) on every call.

![problem 35](https://github.com/cpp-rakesh/discrete_mathematics_and_its_applications/blob/master/chapter_5_induction_and_recursion/5.4_recursive_algorithms/exercises/repo/problem_35.jpg)

![solution](https://github.com/cpp-rakesh/discrete_mathematics_and_its_applications/blob/master/chapter_5_induction_and_recursion/5.4_recursive_algorithms/exercises/repo/solution_35.jpg)

Iterative version has O(n) time complexity.
However, recursive one is doing 7 multiplications in one go and they are re calculating f(n - 2) and f(n - 1) again and again.
Therefore, O(7^n) is less efficient than O(n).

#### Solution
Let's prove by principal of Mathematical induction
Base case
when string size = 0, no need of reverse
Inductive case
swap nth char with 1st char.
swap n - 1 char with 2nd char.
as we are doing it in the algorithm
so inductive hypothesis is
swap kth char with (n - k)th char
Inductive step is
swap (k + 1)th char with (n - (k + 1))th char
Therefor, hence proved


![problem 40](https://github.com/cpp-rakesh/discrete_mathematics_and_its_applications/blob/master/chapter_5_induction_and_recursion/5.4_recursive_algorithms/exercises/repo/problem_40.jpg)

#### Solution
Let's prove by principal of Mathematical induction
Base case
When f(0) return the bitstring, no need of concatination
Inductive case
f(1) = s + f(0), it will concatinate string 1 time
f(2) = s + f(1), it will conactinate string 2 times
Inductive hypothesis
f(k) = s + f(k - 1), it will concatinate string kth times.
Add s on both the sides
s + s + f(k - 1) = conatinating string (k + 1)th time.
Therefore, our algorithm is correct. Hence Proved.

![problem 47](https://github.com/cpp-rakesh/discrete_mathematics_and_its_applications/blob/master/chapter_5_induction_and_recursion/5.4_recursive_algorithms/exercises/repo/problem_47.jpg)

#### Solution
Because Merge in Merge Sort does compare elements of both the list until one doesn't have any elements.
So if in worst case scenario we will have (m + n) comparissions. But there will be one element left in one of the lists.
Therefore, we can say we need most (m + n) - 1 comparissions.
Example, 1 3 and 2 4
1 < 2, 2 < 3 and 3 < 4
In this case also we will have 4 as last left over.
Therefore we have (2 + 2) - 1 comparissions.

We can at least two comparissions
a) 1 4 and d) 4 4
1 < 4 and 4 < 4 that's it

#### Solution
If we have only 4 elements in the list.
Let's say we have 3 8 1 2
Take 2 as pivot, we need 3 comparissions.
it will become 1 2 3 8.
Then we will have 2 more comparissions.
In total we need 5 comparissions.

#### Solution
Let's say we have 1 2 3 4, sorted list alreay.
In first time pivot = 4, then we will have 4 comparissions and after that nothing is needed.
Because the start will be zero and end will be 3.
Least comparissions = 3.

#### Solution
Normal pivot Quick Sort Partition can have O(n ^ 2).
And randamizod can have O(nlg(n)) like Merge Sort.
